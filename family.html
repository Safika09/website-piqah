            <h2> IBU & ABAH</h2>
            <p>This is my parents. Their name is  Hasnita and Shuhaimi. They are an amazing human being that it would be so rigth for me to wish for them to be my parents again in any lifetime that I live in.</p>
            <p>They both 41 and 43 years old this year. It been such a long journey for them knowing me since my day one. Yet I only know them only half of their time.</p>
            <p>I litterally wish for nothing but their happiness and wellbeing in any situation that they face whether I am with them or not. And by that I could only
                pray for The Almighty ALLAH and praying for the best. </p>

            <h2> EBIY</h2>
            <p>Judging by the name above, you must thought that his is my someone special rigth. NO! He is my beloved brother. His name is Zarif Firdaus Hakimi, such a mouthful name.</p>
            <p>He is just three years younger than me and the only sibling that I have. I could not imagine if something happens to him. The thought that we will seperate in our ways are killing me sometimes. </p>
            <p>But thats life right. I love him even though we always fighting. As his sister, I will always be with him and supporting him through his life. After all, we only got each other in this whole world.</p>

            <p>But that does not mean she is a spoilt person. She is the person that I admire the most. Her way of thinking, and patient and resilience make me question my own mental. </p>
            <p>She taught a lot of things that my mom could'nt and take me under her wings. I always took her as my go to person but I know I'm not her's. I will always praying for her happiness. </p>
