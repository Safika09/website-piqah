            <p>I am currently continuing my study at Universiti Teknoloi Mara (UiTM) for my diploma. I take Information Management Program. Yet this is my second courses actually.</p>
            <p>The  first program that I take is Computer Science. However, I chicken out after 1 year due to some complication. However, I did not give up on my study.  </p>
            <p>I take a step back and pick another course for me to finish my diploma study. I took the issue as a life lesson for me to do better in future. </p>

            <p>There would always a challange in any time in our life. My secondary school life, I mostly fun before mental burnout hit after the Peperiksaan Tingkatan 3.</p>
            <p>I would trade anything in life to go back to the time I was in high school. It such a fruitfull time for me.</p>

            <h2> Sekolah Kebangsaan Chiku 3</h2>
            <p>I had a merry time during my school days. Everydays full of laughter and jokes from other classmate. The way we running accross the corridor during the recess.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I miss my childhood moments at the school. I always thought that I lost my childhood as I am the overachiever students in the early days.</p>
            <p>I miss the teachers a lot too especially Sir Roslin, a bald headed teacher, teaching Bahasa Melayu. I hope all the teacher are doing well and remember me too.</p>
